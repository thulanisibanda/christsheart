          <h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px">A Heart to Serve</h1>
          <p>
            We believe that everyone has a place to serve in the body of Christ

            the Christ’s Heart Church family. Whatever your gifting is, please

          </p>
          <h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px">A Desire to Pray</h1>
          <p>
            As a church we believe in the power of prayer as an act of
            worship, to change nations and see God’s will outworked in the lives
            of people. We would encourage you to set aside time daily to pray
            for the church family and to attend the weekly prayer gathering, so
            together we can see the Kingdom of God established - Mark 11 v 22 –
            26, Matthew 18 v 19, Romans 8 v 26 – 28 and James 5 v 16b
          </p>

          <h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px">Statement Of Faith</h1>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            WE BELIEVE... <br />
            a) The Scriptures are Inspired by God and declare His design and
            plan for mankind. <br />
            b) There is only One True God–revealed in three persons...Father,
            Son, and Holy Spirit (commonly known as the Trinity).<br />
            c) In the Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. As God's son Jesus was
            both human and divine.<br />
            d) Though originally good, Man Willingly Fell to Sin–ushering evil
            and death, both physical and spiritual, into the world.<br />
            e) Every Person Can Have Restored Fellowship with God Through
            'Salvation'(trusting practice two ordinances— (1) Water Baptism by
            Immersion after repenting of one's sins and receiving Christ's gift
            of salvation, and (2) Holy Communion(the Lord's Supper) as a
            symbolic remembrance Christ, through faith and repentance, to be our
            personal Savior)and of Christ's suffering and death for our
            salvation. <br />
            f) That the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is a Special Experience
            Following Salvation that empowers believers for witnessing and
            effective service, just as it did in New Testament times.<br />
            g) The Initial Physical Evidence of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit
            is ‘Speaking in Tongues,’ as experienced on the Day of Pentecost and
            referenced throughout Acts and the Epistles.<br />
            h) Sanctification Initially Occurs at Salvation and is not only a
            declaration that a believer is holy, but also a progressive lifelong
            process of separating from evil as believers continually draws us
            closer to God and we become more Christ like.<br />
            i) The Church has a Mission to seek and save all who are lost in
            sin. We believe 'the Church' is the Body of Christ and consists of
            the people who, throughout time, have accepted God's offer of
            redemption (regardless of religious denomination) through the
            sacrificial death of His son Jesus Christ. <br />
            j) A Divinely Called and Scripturally Ordained fivefold ministry of
            Apostle, prophet, teacher, pastor and evangelist Ministry; Serves
            the Church. The Bible teaches that each of us under leadership must
            commit ourselves to reach others for Christ, to worship Him with
            other believers, to build up or edify the body of believers–the
            Church and to Meet human need with ministries of love and
            compassion.<br />
            k) Divine Healing of the Sick and raising of the dead is a Privilege
            for Christians Today and is provided for in Christ's atonement (His
            sacrificial death on the cross for our sins).
            <br />
            l) In The Blessed Hope—When Jesus Raptures His Church Prior to His
            Return to Earth (the second coming). At this future moment in time
            all believers who have died will rise from their graves and will
            meet the Lord in the air, and Christians who are alive will be
            caught up with them, to be with the Lord forever. [1 of 4 cardinal
            doctrines of the AG] <br />
            m) In The Millennial Reign of Christ when Jesus returns with His
            saints at His second coming and begins His benevolent rule over
            earth for 1,000 years. This millennial reign will bring the
            salvation of national Israel and the establishment of universal
            peace. <br />
            n) A Final Judgment Will Take Place for those who have rejected
            Christ. They will be judged for their sin and consigned to eternal
            punishment in a punishing lake of fire. <br />
            o) and look forward to the perfect New Heavens and a New Earth that
            Christ is preparing for all people, of all time, who have accepted
            Him. We will live and dwell with Him there forever following His
            millennial reign on Earth. 'And so shall we forever be with the
            Lord!'
